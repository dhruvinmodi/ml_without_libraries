# ml_without_libraries
This repository contains major machine learning algorithms and its real-life use on webpage. There are mainly three unique things that make difference. 1) All algorithms are handicrafted, NO librery used for training model so you can learn how these algorithm works in depth. 2) I have used Jupyter notbook where I have explained why and when such algorithm should be used along with related equations in LatTex format. 3) All algorithm comes with an web page where respective algorithms is used to predict so you can get idea that how such algorithm can be used.  Currently Neuralnetwork ain't available but stay tuned it will.
