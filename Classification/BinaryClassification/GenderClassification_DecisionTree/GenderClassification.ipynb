    "## When to use Decision tree\n",
    "    - It can be used for both Classification as well as regression also.\n",
    "    - It can capture nonlinear relationsip.\n",
    "    - Most commonly used algorithm.\n",
    "    - It can predict based on training data only so if new unkonwn data is given to model then it would not predict accuratly. So this algorithm should be used where input parameter are known by model.\n",
    "    - It suffers from overfitting so when tree become very dense it overfit the model. It can be prevented by two methods.\n",
    "        1. Pruning non significant branches from tree.\n",
    "        2. Use random forest instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "    - No assumption (Non parametric)\n",
